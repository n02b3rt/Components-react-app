    /* 
    If we were not using JSX then this code:
    <div>
      <h2>Let's get started</h2>
      <Expenses items={expenses}/>
    </div>
    It would look like this:
    React.createElement(
      "div",
      "",
      React.createElement("h2", {}, "Let's get started<"),
      React.createElement(Expenses, {items: expenses})
    )
    Therefore, it is important to remember that there must always be a wprapper for other elements because the returned element is an array.
